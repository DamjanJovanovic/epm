<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>EPM is a simple cross-platform tool that generates software and patch distributions in various formats from a list of files. Supported formats include:</p>

<ul>
<li>AIX software packages (“installp”)</li>
<li>AT&T software packages (“pkgadd”), used by Solaris and others</li>
<li>BSD packages (“pkg_create”)</li>
<li>Compaq Tru64 UNIX (“setld”)</li>
<li>Debian Package Manager (“dpkg”)</li>
<li>HP-UX software packages (“swinstall”)</li>
<li>IRIX software manager (“inst”, “swmgr”, or “tardist”)</li>
<li>macOS software packages (“name.pkg”)</li>
<li>Portable (installation and removal scripts with tar files)</li>
<li>Red Hat Package Manager (“rpm”)</li>
<li>Slackware software packages (“name.tgz”)</li>
</ul>

<p>EPM also includes graphical “setup” and “uninstall” programs that can be provided with your distributions to make installation and removal of more than one package a snap. The installers can be customized with product logos, “readme” files, and click-wrap licenses as desired.</p>

<a name="why-you-might-need-it" class="anchor" href="#why-you-might-need-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why you might need it</h2>

<P>EPM was designed from the beginning to build binary software
distributions using a common software specification format. The
same distribution files work for all operating systems and all
distribution formats. Supporting source code distributions was
not a goal since most RPM and Debian source distributions are
little more than wrapping around a compressed tar file
containing the source files and a configure script.</P>

<P>Over the years, additional features have made their way into
EPM to support more advanced software packages. Whenever
possible, EPM emulates a feature if the vendor package format
does not support it natively.</P>

<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>
    EPM was originally written by Michael Sweet (https://www.msweet.org/epm/) as part of his Easy Software Products effort.
    It was for a long time maintained by Michael until around 2018 when development was moved to Maintenance Mode on
    the project. 
</p>
<p>
    EPM was, and still is, an important dependency for numerous open source projects, especially Apache OpenOffice, which uses EPM to create
    our complimentary community builds. I (jimjag), saw the need to keep EPM alive and kicking, as well as officially folding into
    the project the various AOO features needed by the OpenOffice project. Also, we needed to continue to support some platforms that
    the official EPM distro deprecated.
</p>
<p>
    With all that in mind, jimjag contacted Michael and offered to take on and "take over" active development and maintenance of EPM, to which Michael graciously agreed to.
